# Comprehensive-Framework-to-Safeguard-Organizational-Data-and-IT-Systems

## Overview
This repository provides a detailed framework and resources for safeguarding organizational data and IT systems. The goal is to offer a structured approach to identify, protect, detect, respond to, and recover from security threats while ensuring compliance with industry standards.

## Objectives
- Establish robust policies and procedures for data protection.
- Implement technical controls to secure IT infrastructure.
- Enhance detection capabilities for cybersecurity threats.
- Define incident response and recovery plans.
- Promote a culture of security awareness across the organization.

## Framework Components

### 1. **Governance and Risk Management**
- **Policy Development:** Templates for creating security policies (e.g., Acceptable Use Policy, Data Classification Policy).
- **Risk Assessment:** Tools and processes for identifying and mitigating risks.
- **Compliance Mapping:** Aligning practices with frameworks like ISO 27001, NIST CSF, or GDPR.

### 2. **Technical Security Measures**

- **Network Security:**
  - **pfSense Example Configuration:**
    ```
    # Example pfSense NAT Rule Configuration
    NAT 1:1 Mapping
    Interface: WAN
    External Subnet IP: 203.0.113.10
    Internal IP: 192.168.1.100
    Protocol: TCP/UDP
    Ports: 80 (HTTP), 443 (HTTPS)
    ```
  - **Wireshark Filter Command:**
    ```
    # Capture only traffic on port 80 (HTTP)
    tcp.port == 80
    ```
  - **Nmap Command Example:**
    ```bash
    # Scan for open ports and detect OS on a target
    nmap -A 192.168.1.1
    ```

- **Endpoint Security:**
  - Recommendations for endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools.
  - Scripts for enforcing patch management and antivirus deployment.

- **Data Protection:**
  - Guides for encrypting data at rest and in transit.
  - Backup strategies and tools (e.g., Duplicati, Veeam).
- **Network Security:**
  - Configuration guides for firewalls, VPNs, and Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS).
  - Examples include pfSense, Wireshark, and Nmap configurations.
- **Endpoint Security:**
  - Recommendations for endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools.
  - Scripts for enforcing patch management and antivirus deployment.

### 3. **Threat Detection and Monitoring**

- **Log Management:**
  - Configuration of centralized logging systems like ELK Stack or Splunk.
  - Example ELK Stack configuration for log ingestion:
    ```yaml
    # Example Logstash Configuration
    input {
      beats {
        port => 5044
      }
    }

    filter {
      grok {
        match => { "message" => "%{COMBINEDAPACHELOG}" }
      }
    }

    output {
      elasticsearch {
        hosts => ["http://localhost:9200"]
        index => "logs-%{+YYYY.MM.dd}"
      }
      stdout { codec => rubydebug }
    }
    ```

  - Example script for automated anomaly detection using logs:
    ```python
    import json
    import requests

    # Define Elasticsearch endpoint
    ELASTIC_URL = "http://localhost:9200/logs-*/_search"

    # Query to detect anomalies
    query = {
        "query": {
            "bool": {
                "must": [
                    {"range": {"@timestamp": {"gte": "now-1h", "lte": "now"}}},
                    {"match": {"status": "500"}}
                ]
            }
        }
    }

    response = requests.get(ELASTIC_URL, headers={"Content-Type": "application/json"}, data=json.dumps(query))

    if response.status_code == 200:
        logs = response.json()
        print("Detected anomalies:")
        for hit in logs["hits"]["hits"]:
            print(hit["_source"])
    else:
        print(f"Error fetching logs: {response.status_code}")
    ```

### 4. **Incident Response**
- **Playbook Template:** Below is a template example for an Incident Response Playbook:

  #### Incident Response Playbook Template
  ```
  **Title:** [Incident Type - e.g., Ransomware Attack]

  **Objective:** Provide clear steps to contain, eradicate, and recover from the incident.

  **Steps:**
  1. **Detection and Analysis:**
     - Confirm the incident by analyzing logs and alerts.
     - Identify affected systems and scope of impact.
  
  2. **Containment:**
     - Isolate affected systems from the network.
     - Apply temporary fixes to prevent further spread.

  3. **Eradication:**
     - Remove malicious files or software.
     - Patch vulnerabilities exploited during the attack.

  4. **Recovery:**
     - Restore data from backups if necessary.
     - Reconnect systems to the network and validate functionality.

  5. **Post-Incident:**
     - Document the incident details and lessons learned.
     - Update policies and playbooks to prevent recurrence.
  
  **Stakeholders to Notify:**
  - [List of internal and external stakeholders]

  **Tools Required:**
  - [e.g., Wireshark, FTK, Endpoint Protection Suite]
  ``` **Playbooks:** Step-by-step guides for responding to common incidents (e.g., ransomware, phishing attacks).
- **Forensic Analysis:** Using tools like Autopsy or FTK for post-incident investigations.
- **Communication Plans:** Templates for notifying stakeholders and regulatory bodies.

### 5. **Recovery and Business Continuity**
- **Disaster Recovery Plans:** Detailed steps to restore critical systems.
- **Business Impact Analysis (BIA):** Identifying essential services and recovery time objectives.
- **Resilience Testing:** Regular simulations to ensure readiness.

### 6. **Security Awareness Training**
